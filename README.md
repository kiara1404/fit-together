### Introduction
Welcome to my 'dating' app repository. I am developing an app that's focusing on finding the right workout partner, so it's not a dating app in the traditional way. 
This application lays it's main focus on matching. After benchmarking some well known dating apps I figured out why most of the matches fail for a long term relationship; almost all of the apps are based on appearance. For a further explanation you can go to my [wiki](https://github.com/kiara1404/dating_app/wiki), I've documented my research there.
